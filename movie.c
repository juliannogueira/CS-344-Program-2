/*
 * The file will contain the following column headers and max lengths:
 * Title [255], Year [4], Languages [(5 * 20) + 4 + 2], Rating Value [2].
 * 
 * Each character in the file is checked and stored in a buffer, until the EOF
 * is reached.
 * 
 * The first line of the file is read, but no processing takes place.
 * 
 * The index, column, and line are tracked and reset throughout the function.
 * 
 * When a ',' or '\n' is encountered, it triggers the data in the buffer to be
 * written to a movie struct. If the column number equals 0 at this trigger, a
 * new movie struct will be created first and linked accordingly.
 * 
 * All data from the file will be read into a char buffer. The buffer will be
 * manually null terminated. Once the data is assigned to a movie struct
 * attribute, the data will be converted to the respective data type.
 * 
 * The column number is reset when a '\n' is encountered. This is what
 * determines which attribute to write the data too.
 * 
 * After the file is processed, if the column number is not equal to 0, then
 * the last character was not a new line. Therefore, data is still in the
 * buffer, and it needs to be written to the current column.
 * 
 * The head of a Movie linked list is returned.
